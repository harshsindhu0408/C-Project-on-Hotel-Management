The user can also search for the customer’s detail from their room numbers. He/she can check the total room’s allotted which shows room numbers, customer’s name, their addresses, and phone numbers. All the stored records can be modified and deleted. The last feature of this mini project is about payments. By entering the room number, the system displays the total bill of the customer.

The system uses an external file to store the user’s data permanently.
